# robynn-mcp-server Handoff

Last updated: 2026-05-14

For future agents:

1. Start with `docs/agent-context/START_HERE.md`.
2. Run `scripts/context-check.sh`.
3. Inspect Beads with `bd ready --json` after bootstrap.
4. Keep PRs scoped to this repo unless the user asks for coordinated cross-repo work.

When a change affects `robynnv3` or `robynnv3_agents`, update the relevant repo in its own branch/PR and only update the root workspace submodule pointer after those PRs land.
